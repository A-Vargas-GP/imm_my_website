                    <li> 
                        Uses a simplistic font (Helvetica Neue) 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Is easy on the eyes
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Not difficult to read. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li> 
                        Color scheme (blue, white, black) is not complicated and is not too flashy.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Has an easy layout for a user to understand.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Tabs that can lead to different parts of a page
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Is not too difficult to follow since the tab is highlighted to make sure you are clicking on the right one
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Color changes in accordance to what tab you’ve selected like “home”, “messages”, etc.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Serves as a social media outlet
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Can communicate with others around the world and under friends' tweets or media pictures
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                Can upload thoughts or feelings for others to view
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                Can see what's "trending" at current time
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> <a href = "https://www.webtoons.com/en/" target = "_blank" > Webtoons </a>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Uses a simple font
                        <ul>
                            <li> Is not too harsh on the eyes </li>
                            <li> Comes in white, black, or green </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Promotes almost every “original” story so users can see the art style and click on the one they’d enjoy 
                        <ul>
                            <li> Is unlike most other comic websites like Tapas, which only shows four stories and fills the rest of the page with unrelated topics </li>
                        </ul> 
                            
                    </li>
                        
                    <li>
                        Tabs are easy to use and organized by sections such as “Genres”, “Most Popular by Genre”, and “New to Webtoons”
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                For example, the website has a section that shows what story chapters are released depending on the day of the week.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the tab “Saturday” is selected, it changes color, and different stories appear.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Allows any user to post their drawings or comics for others to enjoy
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> <a href = "https://www.twitch.tv/" target = "_blank"> Twitch </a>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Utilizes the following colors: white, black, and purple. 
                        <ul>
                            <li> A simple yet pleasing color scheme that pairs well </li>
                            <li> Is not harsh on the eyes </li>
                        </ul> 
                    </li>
                
                    <li> Font is not difficult to read </li>
                    
                    <li> Text size changes depending on what video you click on </li>
                    
                    <li> Doesn’t overcomplicate it by adding a lot of tabs and keeps it straightforward by adding only three at the top bar </li> 
                    
                    <li> If a user wants to watch a streamer while browsing for others, Twitch minimizes the current stream in the bottom left corner and allows the user to search on its site for other streamers 
                        <ul>
                            <li> Is quite useful since most other sites force the user out of the current stream if they want to search for other categories or streamers </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        In the “Browse” section, Twitch adds the title of the categories as well as pictures so users can select whatever topic might interest them. 
                        <ul>
                            <li> Nice to see since other sites may only place the title of the categories in a way similar to how Wikipedia formats their site </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Can serve as a job to some
                        <ul>
                            <li> Streamers can get sponsorships or donations from viewers </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Fun to interact with streamers who play a game a viewer might be interested in
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
