    <p> On February 4, 2019, Respawn Entertainment, a video game development company, released a new battle royale game called Apex Legends for the following
        consoles: PS4, Xbox One, and PC. After the first week, they gained 25 million players, and by the end of the first month, they had around 50 million
        players. It managed to gain this much popularity without having any previous announcement or using marketing, which is very surprising. The game features characters
        called 'Legends' whose names are Wraith, Lifeline, Gibraltar, Octane, Crypto, Bloodhound, Mirage, Wattson, Caustic, Pathfinder, and Bangalore. Respawn is
        currently developing one or two more characters whose names might be Forge, Revenant, or Loba. Upon beginning a game, players are placed into a three person
        squad, and they must find weapons, armor, or equipment to survive throughout the map by fighting other squads. The last squad standing is crowned the 'Apex Champions.' </p>
